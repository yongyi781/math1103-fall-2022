# math1103-fall-2022

This is my repository of problem sets, exams, and other notes when teaching MATH1103 Calculus II in Boston College, in Fall 2022. I used Strang's _Calculus_ and Mark Reeder's in-house MATH1103 course notes (not included). I quite like how my problem sets and exams turned out, feel free to take a look!
